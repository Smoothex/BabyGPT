# BabyGPT - a simple project for me to play around with OpenAI's API
## Prerequisites
 - At least Python 3.8
 - OpenAI API key - you can generate one, by [creating an account](https://openai.com/api/), then navigating to Personal > View API key > Create new secret key, then save the API key to a file named ```.env``` in a variable called ```OPENAI_API_KEY```
 - ```pip install openai``` - installs the OpenAI library
 - ```pip install python-dotenv``` - allows the application to fetch environmental variables from a .env file
